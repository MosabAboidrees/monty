## 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

This project focuses on the implementation of stacks and queues in the C programming language. Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used in computer science to manage data in a specific order.

In this project, you will learn about the concepts of LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) and how they relate to stacks and queues. You will also explore various operations that can be performed on stacks and queues, such as push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue.

By understanding and implementing stacks and queues, you will gain a deeper understanding of data structures and their applications in solving real-world problems.
